# Flappy-Bird-Python
MLH: Local Hack Day challenged us to make a one button game, Taking up the challenge, I made a Flappy Bird Game in Python. <br>
Flappy bird is a classic single button game which is simple and easy to make as well as really fun to play. <br>
The objective of the game is to keep the bird flying without hitting the ground or pipes. The bird falls and flaps, each flap moves the bird upwards by a certain amount.<br>
The game is made using pygame module of python. and requires python to be installed on the device to run.<br>
This project is built for MLH: Local Hack Day-3 and is a part of [#100DaysOfCode](https://github.com/SiddharthaBhattacharjee/100Days-of-Code)
